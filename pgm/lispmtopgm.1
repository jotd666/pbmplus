.TH lispmtopgm 1 "06 March 1990"
.IX lispmtopgm
.SH NAME
lispmtopgm - convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file into pgm format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lispmtopgm
.RI [ lispmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a Lisp Machine bitmap as input.
.IX "Lisp Machine bitmap"
Produces a portable graymap as output.
.PP
This is the file format written by the tv:write-bit-array-file function on
TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.
.PP
Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image file
format does not include a color map, so we must treat it as a graymap 
instead.  This is unfortunate.

.SH BUGS
The Lispm bitmap file format is a bit quirky;  Usually the image in the file
has its width rounded up to the next higher multiple of 32, but not always.
If the width is not a multiple of 32, we don't deal with it properly, but 
because of the Lispm microcode, such arrays are probably not image data 
anyway.
.PP
Also, the lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in that if you are writing a
bitmap which is not mod32 across, the file may be up to 7 bits too short!  They
round down instead of up, and we don't handle this bug gracefully.
.PP
No color.
