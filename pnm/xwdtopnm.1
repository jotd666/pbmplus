xwdtopnm - convert a X11 or X10 window dump file into a portable anymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xwdtopnm
.RI [ xwdfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a X11 or X10 window dump file as input.
.IX XWD
.IX "X window system"
Produces a portable anymap as output.
The type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's
black & white, a
.I pbm
file is written, else if it's grayscale a
.I pgm
file, else a
.I ppm
file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.
.PP
Using this program, you can convert anything on an X workstation's screen
into an anymap.
Just display whatever you're interested in, do an xwd, run it through
xwdtopnm, and then use pnmcut to select the part you want.
.SH BUGS
I haven't tested this tool with very many configurations, so there are
probably bugs.
Please let me know if you find any.
