.TH ppmtopict 1 "15 April 1990"
.IX ppmtopict
.SH NAME
ppmtopict - convert a portable pixmap into a Macintosh PICT file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ppmtopict
.RI [ ppmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Produces a Macintosh PICT file as output.
.IX PICT
.IX Macintosh
.PP
The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.
You will need a program such as
.I mcvert
to generate a Macbinary or a BinHex file that contains the necessary
information to identify the file as a PICT file to MacOS.
.PP
Even though PICT supports 2 and 4 bits per pixel,
.I ppmtopict
always generates an 8 bits per pixel file.
.SH BUGS
The picture size field is only correct if the output is to a file
since writing into this field requires seeking backwards on a file.
However the PICT documentation seems to suggest that this field is
not critical anyway since it is only the lower 16 bits of the picture size.
