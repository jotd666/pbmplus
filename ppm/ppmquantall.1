.TH ppmquantall 1 "27 July 1990"
.IX ppmquantall
.SH NAME
ppmquantall - run ppmquant on a bunch of files all at once, so they share a common colormap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ppmquantall
.I ncolors ppmfile
.RI ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Takes a bunch of portable pixmap as input.
Chooses
.I ncolors
colors to best represent all of the images, maps the
existing colors to the new ones, and
.B overwrites the input files
with the new quantized versions.
.IX "colormap reduction"
.PP
Verbose explanation: Let's say you've got a dozen pixmaps that you want
to display on the screen all at the same time.  Your screen can only
display 256 different colors, but the pixmaps have a total of a thousand
or so different colors.  For a single pixmap you solve this problem with
.IR ppmquant ;
.IX ppmquant
this script solves it for multiple pixmaps.  All it does is
concatenate them together into one big pixmap, run
.I ppmquant
on that, and then split it up into little pixmaps again.
.PP
(Note that another way to solve this problem is to pre-select a set of
colors and then use
.IR ppmquant 's
.B -map
option to separately quantize each pixmap to that set.)
