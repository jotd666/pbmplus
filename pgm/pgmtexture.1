.SH NAME
pgmtexture - calculate textural features on a portable graymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pgmtexture
.RB [ -d
.IR d ]
.RI [ pgmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable graymap as input.  Calculates textural features
based on spatial dependence matrices at 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees for
a distance 
.IR d 
(default = 1).
Textural features include:
.IP
(1) Angular Second Moment,
.br
(2) Contrast,
.br
(3) Correlation,
.br
(4) Variance,          
.br
(5) Inverse Difference Moment,
.br
(6) Sum Average,
.br
(7) Sum Variance,
.br
(8) Sum Entropy,
.br
(9) Entropy,
.br
(10) Difference Variance,
.br
(11) Difference Entropy,
.br
(12, 13) Information Measures of Correlation, and
.br
(14) Maximal Correlation Coefficient.

.SH BUGS
The program can run incredibly slow for large images (larger than 64 x 64)
and command line options are limited.
The method for finding (14) the maximal correlation coefficient, which
requires finding the second largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does not
always converge.
