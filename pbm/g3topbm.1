.IX fax
Produces a portable bitmap as output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -kludge
Tells
.I g3topbm
to ignore the first few lines of the file;
sometimes fax files have some junk at the beginning.
.TP
.B -reversebits
Tells
.I g3topbm
to interpret bits least-significant
first, instead of the default most-significant first.
Apparently some fax modems do it one way and others do it the other way.
If you get a whole bunch of "bad code word" messages, try using this
flag.
.TP
.B -stretch
Tells
.I g3topbm
to stretch the image vertically by
duplicating each row.
This is for the low-quality transmission mode.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
