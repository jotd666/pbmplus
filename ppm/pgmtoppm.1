.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pgmtoppm

.B pgmtoppm
.IB colorspec1 - colorspec2
.RI [ pgmfile ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable graymap as input.
Colorizes it by multiplying the the gray values by specified color or colors,
and produces a portable pixmap as output.
.IX colorization
.PP
If only one color is specified, black in the pgm file stays black and
white in the pgm file turns into the specified color in the ppm file.
If two colors (separated by a dash) are specified, then black gets mapped
to the first color and white gets mapped to the second.
.PP
The color can be specified in five ways:
.IX "specifying colors"
.TP 
o
A name, assuming
that a pointer to an X11-style color names file was compiled in.
.TP 
o
An X11-style hexadecimal specifier: rgb:r/g/b, where r g and b are
each 1- to 4-digit hexadecimal numbers.
.TP 
o
An X11-style decimal specifier: rgbi:r/g/b, where r g and b are
floating point numbers between 0 and 1.
.TP 
o
For backwards compatibility, an old-X11-style hexadecimal
number: #rgb, #rrggbb, #rrrgggbbb, or #rrrrggggbbbb.
.TP 
o
For backwards compatibility, a triplet of numbers
separated by commas: r,g,b, where r g and b are
floating point numbers between 0 and 1.
(This style was added before MIT came up with the similar rgbi style.)
.PP
Also, the
.B -map
flag lets you specify an entire colormap to be used.
The mapfile is just a
.I ppm
file; it can be any shape, all that matters
is the colors in it and their order.
In this case, black gets mapped into the first
color in the map file, and white gets mapped to the last.
