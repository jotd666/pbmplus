.SH NAME
pjtoppm - convert an HP PaintJet file to a portable pixmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pjtoppm
.RI [ paintjet ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads an HP PaintJet file as input and converts it into a portable pixmap.
This was a quick hack to save some trees, and it only handles a small
subset of the paintjet commands.
In particular, it will only handle 
enough commands to convert most raster image files.
