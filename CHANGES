Changes since the 30oct91 patch version:

    Fixed uninitialized variable in ppmtotga.  (John Walker)
    Added pgmcrater, ppmforge, ppmtoacad, sldtoppm.  (John Walker)
    Slight change to the p?mmerge.c front-ends to allow for main programs
      that return instead of exitting.
    Minor clarifications to the pnmconvol man page.
    Fixed xwdtopnm to read some 16-bit True/Direct files. (David Elliott)
    Fixed uninitialized variables in pnmtotiff.  (Larry Rosenstein, Bayles Holt)
    Added a couple of checks for \r while reading whitespace. (Larry Rosenstein)
    Removed all the BROKENPUTC stuff.  Now we ignore all return values from
      putc(), and check ferror() in pm_close().  Added pm_close() calls to
      many of the filters.
    Fixed pnmdepth to check for too-large newmaxvals.  Improved rounding
      in pnmdepth and PPM_DEPTH macro.  (Tom Lane)

    Fixed minor SysV config error in pbmplus.h.  (Tom Lane)
    Fixed tifftopnm so that BITSPERSAMPLE and SAMPLESPERPIXEL default
      correctly.  Fixed possible bug in tgatoppm line-interleaving code.
      (Arthur David Olson)

    Fix to 24/32 bit case in rasttopnm.  (Behr de Ruiter)
    Float/double portability fix to libppm4.  (Bruce Holmer, Ronald Khoo)
    Fixed typo in compat.ksh.  (Larry Virden)
    Fixed int/short incompatibility in tifftopnm.  (Salik Rafiq)

Changes during the extended beta test period, starting on 15jan91:

    Lots of fixes from: Anthony A. Datri, Arthur David Olson, David Brooks,
      David Elliott, Doug Claar, Duncan Sinclair, Francois Pinard, Gerard
      Leurs, Jim Hanko, Ken Laprade, Klaus U. Schallhorn, Markus Bolz, Mike
      Hench, Philip Gladstone, R C Smith, Selden E. Ball, Jr., Stephen Uitti,
      Steve Allen, Tom Lane, update.kpj-jaakkola@athena.dsv.su.se,
      Charles Karney, Unmesh Agarwala, Ed Pendzik, Juha Sarlin, Tom Tulinsky,
      Phillip Smith, Lai-King Mau, David Koblas, Mark Donovan.
    Added a global -version flag.
    Added bunches of statics and prototypes.  Now compiles with zero
      warnings under gcc -ansi -pedantic.
    Changed #ifdef __STDC__ to #if __STDC__, since some non-compliant
      compilers define it as 0.
    Changed pm_message and pm_error to be varargs routines.  Added a
      portable version of vfprintf for those systems which don't have it.
    Removed the option of not compiling the pgm and ppm parts.  Very few
      people used it, and it added amazing complexity to the pnm programs,
      turning them into maintenance nightmares.
    Merged pbmpaste into pnmpaste.
    Merged pgmtops and ppmtops into pnmtops.
    Added auto-scaling and dpi / page size flags to pnmtops.
    Changed the interpretation of bits in pbmlife to conform with other
      tools.
    Changed xwdtopnm to ignore the pixel number in the xwd color structure.
    Added a -pseudodepth flag to pnmtoxwd.
    Updated tifftopnm for libtiff 2.4.
    Added many option flags to pnmtotiff.  (J.T. Conklin)
    Added support for X11R5's new color specifiers rgb: and rgbi:.

      pi1toppm, ppmtopi1, sputoppm, spctoppm, pbmto10x, ppmtoicr, ppmmake,
      xpmtoppm, ppmtopuzz, ppmtouil, ybmtopbm, pbmtoybm, lispmtopgm,
      pgmtolispm, pbmtogem, pi3topbm, pbmtopi3, pbmtoepson, pbmtoplot,

      ppmtopcx.
    Merged some filters:
      rasttopbm and rasttoppm into rasttopnm;
      pbmtorast and ppmtorast into pnmtorast;
      xwdtopbm and xwdtoppm into xwdtopnm;
      pbmtoxwd and ppmtoxwd into pnmtoxwd.
    Promoted some filters:

      ppmarith to pnmarith;
      ppmconvol to pnmconvol;
      ppmcscale to pnmdepth;
      ppmrotate to pnmrotate;
      ppmscale to pnmscale;
      ppmshear to pnmshear;
      ppmsmooth to pnmsmooth;
      tifftopgm to tifftopnm - new version based on Sam Leffler's libtiff.
    Bugfixes to pbmtoicon, ppmtops.
    The Makefiles now have a "merge" option.
    All flags are now case-insensitive.
    Added $(MAKE) stuff to Makefile.
    Changed pnmsmooth from a csh script to a sh script.
    Made macro use in pbmtox10bm and pbmtoxbm more portable.
    Moved compataliases to compat.csh, and added compat.ksh.
    Made ppmtoilbm less Amiga-specific.
    Added -headerskip and -rowskip flags to rawtopgm.
    Enhanced rasttopnm to interpret 8-bit rasters with no colormap as grayscale.
    Changed sscanf %g to %f - some systems can't handle %g on input.
    Added -expand flag to pbmmask.
    Speedup to pnmflip - don't buffer if possible.
    Added color-name-to-value routine to ppm - uses X11's rgb.txt if present.
    Updated Imakefile support to reflect X.V11R4.
    Removed picttopbm.
    Improved pnmcut argument syntax so that negative coords work like pnmpaste.
    Added "magic" file, for use with the "file" program.
    40% speedup for pgmnorm from Robert Stockton (rgs@cs.cmu.edu).
    Fixed long-standing bug involving colormaps on SPARCstations when
      compiled with gcc -- had to do with passing structs by value.
    Removed the -x flag from pnmtorast -- it's not really needed.
    Fixed subtle bug in the pnm reading code that caused pnmcat to blow
      it on images that differed greatly in width or height.
    New version of giftoppm that handles the GIF89a standard, and doesn't
      use fseek.
    Fixed fitstopgm to handle three-axis images, such as the Hubble pix.
    Xwdtopnm and pnmtoxwd finally handle byte-order properly.
    Added -xysize flag to pnmscale.
    Added conditional ANSI function prototypes to library routines.
    Added -noantialias flag to pnmrotate and pnmshear.
    Removed the TIPS file.  No one ever sent in any new tips, so I just
      moved the few I had into the relevant man pages.  That's probably
      where they belonged in the first place.
    Added justification flags to pnmcat.
    Added -map flag to ppmquant - user-specifiable colormap.  Also, the
      Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion finally works right.
    Added -map flag to pgmtoppm.
    Added DirectColor support to xwdtopnm and pnmtoxwd.
    Speedup to pgmtolj from Arthur David Olson: avoid sending whitespace.
    Fix to pbmtogo from Bo Thide': 2D compression now works.

Patch 1 to the X.V11R4 / comp.sources.misc distribution of 22nov89:

    Fixed bug in pgmtops -rle.

Changes since the alt.sources distribution of 13sep89:

    Small corrections to ppmtorast, pgmtops.
    Moved pbm/tifftopbm to pgm/tifftopgm - it now handles grayscale TIFF files.
    Fixed tifftopgm to handle non-native byte order.
    Changes to tifftopgm to handle bogus AppleScan TIFF files, to have
      better command syntax, and to use stdio.
    Optimizations to xbmtopbm, pbmtoxbm, and pbmtox10bm, courtesy of
      Juha Sarlin, to make them go about three times as fast.
    Optimization to pgmtops and ppmtops to make them go three times as fast.
    Optimization to pnmcrop.
    Added PBMPLUS_BROKENPUTC defines in pbmplus.h to handle systems (such as
      ULTRIX) which have broken putc() macros.
    Rewrote ppmscale, pnmcat, and pgmhist to operate line-by-line, instead
      of reading in the whole image.
    Rewrote pnmflip to keep only one copy of the image in memory.
    Added pgmtofits, courtesy of Wilson H. Bent, plus bugfixes to fitstopgm
      and a patch to giftoppm to handle black&white GIF files.
    Added picttopbm and rawtopgm.
    Fixes to xwdtoppm and ppmtoxwd so they compile with SunOS cc as well as gcc.
    Another small change to ppmtoxwd having to do with colormap size.
    Changed macptopbm's -headersize flag to be -extraskip.
    Changed tgatoppm to read color values as BGRA instead of ARGB; the Targa
      documentation is apparently wrong about the order.
    Some changes to the Makefiles, partially to work around bugs in gnumake.
    Got g3topbm working, and added pbmtog3, courtesy of Paul Haeberli.
    Added some pixrect work-alike code so that rasttopbm, pbmtorast, rasttoppm,
      and ppmtorast can be used on non-Sun systems.  This also provides a
      final solution to the persistent byte- and bit-order problems on 386's.
    Moved the SYSV-checking #ifdefs to *after* the include of pbm.h, which
      defines SYSV.
    Made all the #else's and #endif's ANSI-compliant.
    Added manual pages for libpbm, libpgm, libppm, and libpnm, courtesy
      of Tony Hansen.
    Changed man page installation so that pages from different sections
      can go in different directories.
    Fixed Imakefiles.

Changes since the expo.lcs.mit.edu FTP distribution of 06sep89:

    Added #ifdefs to pnm/libpnm3.c to allow the PBM-PNM-only configuration.
    Small corrections to TIPS, pnm/Makefile, pnm/Imakefile, ppm/ppmrotate.1,
      ppm/ppmshear.1, ppm/ppmtoilbm.c, pbm/xwdtopbm.c, ppm/xwdtoppm.c,
      ppm/ppmtoxwd.c, ppm/ppmtoxwd.1, pbm/x11wd.h.

Changes since the comp.sources.misc distribution of 31oct88:

    Added pbmreduce, pbmlife, pbmmask, and pbmupc.
    Added gemtopbm, tifftopbm, pcxtopbm, pbmtogo, mgrtopbm, pbmtomgr,
      cmuwmtopbm, pbmtocmuwm, g3topbm, and pbmtobg.
    Minor bugfix to pbmtolj.
    Slight restructuring of most of the programs to use vastly less memory.
    Various other minor optimizations.
    Fixed pbmtorast and rasttopbm to handle byte-swapped big-endian 386 boxes.
    Slight changes to argument syntax of pbmcrop, pbmmake, pbmreduce.
    Moved to the new PGM package: pbmtops (which now produces Conforming PS).
    Moved to the new PPM package: giftopbm.
    Moved to the new PNM package: pbmcrop pbmcut pbmenlarge pbminvert.
    Consolidated into a single pnmflip tool: pbmfliplr pbmfliptb pbmtrnspos.
    Consolidated into a single pnmcat tool: pbmcatlr pbmcattb.
    Added compataliases script for upward compatability with changed tools.
    Removed xxxtopbm.
    Added a -headersize flag to macptopbm, to help get around annoying
      problems in MacPaint file format.
    Added the RAWBITS compilation-time option, to use a more compact and
      much faster (but less portable) external format.
    Removed the CBM format - use compress(1) and / or RAWBITS instead.
    Pbmpaste (and the new pnmpaste) now accepts negative x and y coords,
      which are interpreted relative to the right and bottom sides.
    Changed all programs to accept a "-" file argument as meaning standard
      input.
    Removed pbmtox10wd, since it was never very useful (X10 doesn't have xwud).
    Added Imakefiles, for X11 types to use.

Changes since the X.V11R3 distribution of 31aug88:

    The cbm format has been revised to support run-length encoding.
    Pbmtops now does run-length encoding.

Major changes since the X.V11R2 distribution of 28mar88:

    The pbm format now has a "magic number".
    New conversion filters: brushtopbm, giftopbm, pbmtolj, pbmtomacp,
      pbmtoxwd, and pbmtox10wd.
    Icontopbm converter has a better parser -- it knows to skip over
      any extraneous comments at the beginning of the icon file.
    Pbmtops generates a different PostScript wrapper program -- it should
      handle huge bitmaps better.
    Xwdtopbm now handles byte-swapping correctly.
    Pbmmake takes a flag to specify the color of the new bitmap.
    Pbmpaste now implements 'or', 'and', and 'xor' operations as well
      as the default 'replace'.
