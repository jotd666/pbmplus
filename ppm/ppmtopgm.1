ppmtopgm - convert a portable pixmap into a portable graymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ppmtopgm

Produces a portable graymap as output.

.PP
Note that although there is a
.I pgmtoppm
program, it is not necessary
for simple conversions from
.I pgm
to
.IR ppm ,
because any ppm program can
read
.I pgm
(and
.I pbm
) files automagically.
.I pgmtoppm
is for colorizing a
.I pgm
file.  Also, see
.I ppmtorgb3
.IX ppmtorgb3
for a different way of converting color to gray.
.SH QUOTE
.nf
Cold-hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colors from our sight
Red is gray, and yellow white
But we decide which is right
And which is a quantization error.
