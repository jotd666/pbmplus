.IX pnmdepth
.SH NAME
pnmdepth - change the maxval in a portable anymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pnmdepth
.I newmaxval
.RI [ pnmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable anymap as input.
Scales all the pixel values, and writes out the image with the new maxval.
Scaling the colors down to a smaller maxval will result in some loss
of information.
.PP
Be careful of off-by-one errors when choosing the new maxval.
For instance, if you want the color values to be five bits wide,
use a maxval of 31, not 32.
