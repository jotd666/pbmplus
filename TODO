Things still to be done, in approximate order of likelihood:


The hash table in ppmquant is not really the right data structure.

Imakefile fixes from David Lawrence.

VMS fixes from Terry Poot.

Add IBM, Mac, and Amiga stuff to OTHER.SYSTEMS file.

hipstopgm should have a -image flag like fitstopgm and giftoppm.

Add ppmtocmyk4.

Upgrade xpmtoppm and ppmtoxpm to handle XPM2.

Figure out why compiling pnmconvol makes gcc die on some systems.

Convert to line-by-line mode:
pbmtext.c pbmtoascii.c pbmtoepson.c pbmtomacp.c pbmtoplot.c pgmoil.c

The Converter Generator reorganization: all filters become three library
routines, one to initialize, one to handle each line, and one to finish off.
This will make it possible to generate self-contained pipelines on demand,
and they should run substantially faster without all that I/O.
