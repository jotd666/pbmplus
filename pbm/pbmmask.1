.IX pbmmask
.SH NAME
pbmmask - create a mask bitmap from a regular bitmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pbmmask
.RB [ -expand ]
.RI [ pbmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable bitmap as input.
Creates a corresponding mask bitmap and writes it out.
.PP
The color to be interpreted as "background" is determined automatically.
Regardless of which color is background, the mask will be white where
the background is and black where the figure is.
.PP
This lets you do a masked paste like this, for objects with a black background:
.nf
    pbmmask obj > objmask
    pnmpaste < dest -and objmask <x> <y> | pnmpaste -or obj <x> <y>
.fi
.IX pnmpaste
For objects with a white background, you can either invert them or
add a step:
.nf
    pbmmask obj > objmask
    pnminvert objmask | pnmpaste -and obj 0 0 > blackback
    pnmpaste < dest -and objmask <x> <y> | pnmpaste -or blackback <x> <y>
.fi
.IX pnminvert
Note that this three-step version works for objects with black backgrounds
too, if you don't care about the wasted time.
.PP
You can also use masks with graymaps and pixmaps, using the
.I pnmarith
tool.  For instance:
.nf
    ppmtopgm obj.ppm | pgmtopbm -threshold | pbmmask > objmask.pbm
    pnmarith -multiply dest.ppm objmask.pbm > t1.ppm
    pnminvert objmask.pbm | pnmarith -multiply obj.ppm - > t2.ppm
    pnmarith -add t1.ppm t2.ppm
.fi
.IX pnmarith
An interesting variation on this is to pipe the mask through the
.I pnmsmooth
.IX pnmsmooth
script before using it.  This makes the boundary between the two images less
sharp.
.OPTIONS
.TP
.B -expand
Expands the mask by one pixel out from the image.
This is useful if you want a little white border around your image.
(A better solution might be to turn the
.I pbmlife
tool into a general cellular automaton tool...)
