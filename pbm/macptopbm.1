.SH SYNOPSIS
.B macptopbm

.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a MacPaint file as input.
.IX MacPaint
.IX Macintosh
Produces a portable bitmap as output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -extraskip
This flag is to get around a problem with some methods
of transferring files from the Mac world to the Unix world.
Most of these methods leave the Mac files alone, but a few of
them add the "finderinfo" data onto the front of the Unix file.
This means an extra 128 bytes to skip over when reading the file.
The symptom to watch for is that the resulting PBM file looks shifted
to one side.
If you get this, try
.B -extraskip
128, and if that still doesn't look right try another value.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
