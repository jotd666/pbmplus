.TH pgmtolispm 1 "06 March 1990"
.IX pgmtolispm
.SH NAME
pgmtolispm - convert a portable graymap into Lisp Machine format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pgmtolispm
.RI [ pgmfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable graymap as input.
Produces a Lisp Machine bitmap as output.
.IX "Lisp Machine bitmap"
.PP
This is the file format read by the tv:read-bit-array-file function on
TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.
.PP
Given a pgm (instead of a pbm) a multi-plane image will be output.
This is probably not useful unless you have a color lisp machine.
.PP
Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image file
format does not include a color map, so we must treat it as a graymap 
instead.  This is unfortunate.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
lispmtopgm(1), pgm(5)
.SH BUGS
Output width is always rounded up to the nearest multiple of 32; this might 
not always be what you want, but it probably is (arrays which are not 
modulo 32 cannot be passed to the Lispm BITBLT function, and thus cannot 
easily be displayed on the screen).
.PP
No color.
