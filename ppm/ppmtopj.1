.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input and converts it into a format suitable
to be printed by an HP PaintJet printer.
.PP
For best results, the input file should be in 8-color RGB form;
i.e. it should have only
the 8 binary combinations of full-on and full-off primaries.
You could get this by sending the input file through
.I ppmquant -map
with a map file such as:
.nf
    P3
    8 1
    255
    0 0 0      255 0 0    0 255 0    0 0 255
    255 255 0  255 0 255  0 255 255  255 255 255
.fi
Or else you could use use
.I ppmdither -red 2 -green 2 -blue 2.

.TP
.BI -ypos " pos"
